# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @catalinsuceveanu

I am a software developer with many people skils. I worked as a software developer at Vipra technologies to create a CLI (command line interface) program which pulled requested raw data from an employee time tracking app. After the extraction of different types of data, there are a few types of data processing that can be done to get reports of the efficiency and other metrics. All the reports can be printed in the command line or sent directly to slack, or any other channel.

Also, before converting to software development, I have been a manufacturing automation and business consultant (sales, negociation, communication, leadership). I have worked as a consultant for 6 years.
I have a high level of people skills. I help people be the best version of themselves and find what makes them happy.

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a software development position in ZÃ¼rich, Switerland.

For 2 years now, I have been learning german and been keen on moving to ZÃ¼rich. I love the city, the culture and it simply fit my lifestyle.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, Python, Selenium, Data Structures and Algorithms, Virtual Environments (Poetry)
